# Portfolio

This is my live, active portfolio site on GitHub pages.  It is based on the last Project (9) of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree.  It supercedes the React version that I was building.  It may eventually be replaced with another site built with another framework.

It is a single page static site that was built with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  No libraries or frameworks are used in it's construction.

Its purpose is to act as a landing page for anyone looking for me and has links to my portfolio, blog, GitHub and social media links.  

The blog section in built in Bootstrap and may be changed to a new format.

### Things to fix:

1. Fix the background at the bottom edge of the page.  Right now, the canvas does not fill the entire page.  Also, the starry field does not fill the entire page, either.
2. Update the jobs array to include relevant titles.
3. Improve the jobs animation for when then scroll to the side.
4. Add a "contact" method somewhere.
5. Add cool star animations that are static but twinkle and are more vibrant and visible.
